You can achieve this through various approaches.
For example, you can use Symfony Server with tethered or local data to achieve the following results:

- Create a local development environment for a Symfony site using [Symfony Server](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/symfony_server.html)
- Sync data from the active Platform.sh environment where team review takes place
- Commit aspects of that local development method to the project,
  so collaborators can replicate configuration to contribute
