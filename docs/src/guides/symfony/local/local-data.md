A significant amount of work developing Symfony takes place locally rather than on an active Platform.sh environment.
You want to ensure that the process of local development is as close as possible to a deployed environment.

You can achieve this through various approaches.

To test changes locally, you can pull data from an active Platform.sh environment.

{{% guides/local-requirements name="Symfony" %}}
- your Platform.sh project is using PostgreSQL, otherwise, follow the [Use PostgreSQL tutorial](../customize/postgresql.md)

## Start your Symfony Server
At first, you need to start your web Server locally to display your Symfony application.

```bash
symfony server:start -d
symfony open:local
```

It will start the Symfony server and open the application in your local browser.

## Dump your Platform.sh project's database

Dump your Platform.sh project's database into a local file by running

```bash
symfony cloud:db:dump -f dump.sql
```

## Import dump file locally
```bash
symfony console doctrine:query:sql < dump.sql
```

## Import assets
```bash
symfony cloud:mount:download --mount public/var --target ./public/var
```

Et voilÃ , your local Symfony application is sync with your Platform.sh project
