Please refer to our [Compliance Guidance](https://docs.platform.sh/security/compliance-guidance.html) page for an overview of our compliance program, including security & compensating controls, and a general allocation of responsibility.

## Overview

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are developed with the goal of providing a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally. The WCAG documents explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. 

Platform.sh is committed to building inclusive and easy-to-use websites that are accessible to all users.

## Statement

Our product's main user control interface, for use by customers & developers, is currently WCAG 2.0 AA compliant. As part of our internal roadmap processes, we prioritize continuing maintenance of accessibility compliance (through this published statement, and in general, through our support processes). We solicit user feedback on improvements or feature requests relating to accessibility, which also has a place in our internal prioritization process, although we do not publish an external roadmap.
