Platform.sh provides a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution that our customers may use for applications requiring HIPAA compliance. All HIPAA workloads will run on the US-4 region.

Platform.sh has SOC 2 Type 2 and PCI certifications. As a part of those third-party audits, we have been audited on overlapping HIPAA controls. Independent third-party audits provide an external examination of the controls we have implemented on our infrastructure and operations and ensure Platform.shâ€™s commitment to complying with information security standards and industry best practices.

**Please note that there is no certification recognized by the US Department of Health & Human Services for HIPAA compliance. Thus, complying with HIPAA is a shared responsibility between the customer and Platform.sh.**

Customers who want to run healthcare workloads on Platform.sh must do the following:
* sign up for Elite tier
* sign a Business Associate Agreement with Platform.sh
* implement the relevant controls contained in the [Platform.sh HIPAA Shared Responsibility Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wsve74Bn8ljfE2vJbN1g8vZA4Jd5_lokmZxgUPcJ98k/edit?usp=sharing) (Excel). This document provides guidance on shared responsibilities required to achieve HIPAA compliance. 
* take sole responsibility for their application security. 
* run HIPAA workloads on the HIPAA designated region and take responsibility for managing access to all environments that are included in the HIPAA designated region.
* use [Fastly WAF](https://docs.fastly.com/products/hipaa-compliant-caching-and-delivery) or a Platform.sh-approved equivalent HIPAA-complaint WAF
* perform, at a minimum on an annual basis, penetration testing and vulnerability scanning against their projects based upon industry standards, and remediate findings in a timely manner.
* [redeploy applications](https://docs.platform.sh/security/updates.html) regularly to be able to pick up patches

While Platform.sh provides a secure and compliant infrastructure for processing of PHI, the customer is responsible for ensuring that the environment and applications that they host on Platform.sh are properly configured and secured according to HIPAA requirements. Failure to do so results in a non-compliant customer environment.

Clients can contact their Platform Account Manager to request a BAA or for more information regarding HIPAA compliance.
