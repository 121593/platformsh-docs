title: "Scalability"
weight: 5
description: Part of the original design goal of Platform.shâ€™s Triple Redundant Architecture was to ensure scalability in times of load spikes outside of the bounds of the original traffic specs.  Because the cluster is configured as an N+1 architecture, we can respond to legitimate traffic events by removing a node from the cluster, upsizing it, returning it into rotation, and then repeating the process on the next node in turn.
