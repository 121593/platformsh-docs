Once you've completed the demo, you'll have:

1. A project deployed on {{% vendor/name %}}, which you can delete with the command `{{% vendor/cli %}} project:delete -p PROJECT_ID` before proceeding.
1. You first organization created. You can delete that organization with the command `{{% vendor/cli %}} org:delete -o ORG_NAME`, but you will need to recreate an organization before proceeding to the next step.
