## Use a third-party Git provider

When you choose to use a third-party Git hosting service, the {{< vendor/name >}} Git
repository becomes a read-only mirror of the third-party repository. All your
changes take place in the third-party repository.

Add an integration to your existing third-party repository:

[//]: # (- [BitBucket]&#40;/integrations/source/bitbucket.md&#41;)
- [GitHub](/integrations/source/github.md)

[//]: # (- [GitLab]&#40;/integrations/source/gitlab.md&#41;)
