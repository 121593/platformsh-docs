description: All you need to know about creating a new project with {{% vendor/name %}}
---

To create a new project on {{% vendor/name %}}, you can either use the {{% vendor/name %}} CLI or the {{% vendor/name %}} Console.

title=Using the CLI
+++
To create a new project with the {{% vendor/name %}} CLI, use the following command and follow the prompt:
```bash {location="Terminal"}
{{% vendor/cli %}} project:create
```

{{< note >}}
When creating a new project using the {{% vendor/name %}} CLI command `project:create`, default production branch is set to ``main``, please change it if your default branch is not the same (ex: `master`)

Then, you will be asked if you want to set the local remote to your new project. Enter **Yes (y)**.
Your local source code will be automatically linked to your newly created {{% vendor/name %}} project by creating a `.{{% vendor/cli %}}/local/project.yaml` file that will contain the corresponding `<projectId>` and set a Git remote to `{{% vendor/cli %}}`.

```bash {location="Terminal"}
git remote
{{% vendor/cli %}}
```

If not, please refer to [Set project remote](#set-project-remote) section.

[Create a new project from scratch]({{% create-project-link scratch=true %}}).

If you do not already have an organization created to put the project in, you'll first be instructed to create one.

Once you have done so, select that organization from the dropdown, and select **Create from scratch**.

In the form, fill in details like the project name and [region](/development/regions.md).
You'll be able to define resources for the project after your first push.

After creating a project with the Console, you need to let the {{% vendor/name %}} CLI know which linked project you want to deploy to.

To do so, use the {{% vendor/name %}} CLI to set a remote project:
```bash {location="Terminal"}
{{% vendor/cli %}} project:set-remote <projectId>
```

This command will add a new remote called `{{% vendor/cli %}}` to your local Git repo as you can see below:
```bash {location="Terminal"}
git remote
origin
{{% vendor/cli %}}
```

It will also create a new `.{{% vendor/cli %}}/local/project.yaml` file that will contain the given `<projectId>`, to store this information for the {{% vendor/name %}} CLI interaction.

{{< note >}}
If you donâ€™t remember your `<projectId>` from the previous steps, you can get it back using this command line and select the one you created:
```bash {location="Terminal"}
{{% vendor/cli %}} project:list
```
