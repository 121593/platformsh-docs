title: "Network Storage"
weight: -30

The Network Storage service enables a new kind of [mount](../create-apps/app-reference.md#mounts)
that refers to a shared service rather than to a local directory.
This service allows you to store data and share it between different apps.

## Supported versions

{{% major-minor-versions-note configMinor="true" %}}

{{< image-versions image="network-storage" status="supported" environment="grid" >}}

This service is the {{% vendor/name %}} network storage implementation, not the version of a third-party application.

{{< note theme="warning">}}

It isn't possible to upgrade or downgrade the network storage service version while keeping existing data in place.
Changing the service version requires that the service be reinitialized.
Any change to the service version results in existing data becoming inaccessible.

## Usage example

{{% endpoint-description type="network-storage" noApp=true /%}}

## Multi-application usage

If your project contains [multiple apps](../create-apps/multi-app/_index.md), they can all use the same network mounts.
If the `source_path` is the same for both apps,
the files are shared between the two applications even if the mount location is different.

It's also possible to have one app mount a `source_path` that's a subdirectory of another application's mount.
For example:

```yaml {configFile="apps"}
{{% snippet name="app1" config="apps" %}}
...
mounts:
    'web/uploads':
        source: service
        service: files
        source_path: uploads
{{% /snippet %}}

{{% snippet name="app2" config="apps" globKey="false" %}}
...
mounts:
    'process':
        source: service
        service: files
        source_path: uploads/incoming
    'done':
        source: service
        service: files
        source_path: uploads/done
{{% /snippet %}}
```

In this example, `app1` has access to the entire `uploads` directory by writing to `web/uploads`.
`app2` has two mounts that it can write to: `process` and `done`.
The `process` mount refers to the same directory as the `web/uploads/incoming` directory does on `app1`,
and the `done` mount refers to the same directory as the `web/uploads/done` directory on `app1`.

## How do I give my workers access to my main applicationâ€™s files?

If you need to use a worker with access to the same file mount as your web-serving app,
define all the necessary mounts as `service` mounts.

The following example assumes a Network Storage service named `files` has been defined in `{{< vendor/configfile "services" >}}`.
Drupal files directories are shared between the `web` and `worker` instances,
while the Drush backup directory is unique to the `web` instance.

```yaml {configFile="app"}
name: 'app'
type: 'php:7.2'

relationships:
    database: 'db:mysql'

hooks:
  # ...

web:
    locations:
        '/':
            # ...

disk: 1024

mounts:
    # The public and private files directories are
    # network mounts shared by web and workers.
    'web/sites/default/files':
        source: service
        service: files
        source_path: files
    'private':
        source: service
        service: files
        source_path: private
    # The backup, temp, and cache directories for
    # Drupal's CLI tools don't need to be shared between web and workers.
    # It wouldn't hurt anything to make them network
    # shares, however.
    '/.drush':
        source: storage
        source_path: drush
    'tmp':
        source: tmp
        source_path: tmp
    'drush-backups':
        source: storage
        source_path: drush-backups
    '/.console':
        source: storage
        source_path: console

# Crons run on the web container, so they have the
# same mounts as the web container.
crons:
    drupal:
        spec: '*/20 * * * *'
        commands:
            start: 'cd web ; drush core-cron'

# The worker defined here also has the same 6 mounts;
# 2 of them are shared with the web container,
# the other 4 are local to the worker.
workers:
    queue:
        commands:
            start: |
                cd web && drush queue-run myqueue
```
